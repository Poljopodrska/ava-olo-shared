# ECS Deployment Failure Investigation Report
**Date**: 2025-07-20  
**Investigator**: Claude Code  
**Service**: ava-olo-monitoring-dashboards (ECS)  
**Issue**: Blue debug box deployment failures

## Executive Summary
Successfully resolved ECS deployment failures that were preventing the blue debug box update (v2.3.1-blue-debug) from deploying. Root cause was Docker Hub rate limiting during CodeBuild image pulls. Fixed by switching to ECR public registry.

## Timeline
- **13:30 UTC**: Blue debug box code changes pushed to GitHub
- **13:42 UTC**: CodeBuild triggered but failed during DOWNLOAD_SOURCE phase  
- **13:58 UTC**: Manual CodeBuild triggered, failed during BUILD phase
- **14:00 UTC**: Investigation began, identified Docker Hub rate limiting
- **14:01 UTC**: Applied fix (ECR public registry) and pushed changes
- **14:03 UTC**: Successful build and ECR image push
- **14:05 UTC**: ECS deployment completed successfully

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Docker Hub Rate Limiting
**Error**: `toomanyrequests: You have reached your unauthenticated pull rate limit`

**Details**:
- Dockerfile used `FROM python:3.11-slim` 
- CodeBuild pulled from Docker Hub without authentication
- Docker Hub has strict rate limits for unauthenticated pulls
- This caused build failures in the BUILD phase

### Secondary Issues Investigated
1. **GitHub Access**: Initially suspected, but DOWNLOAD_SOURCE phase was succeeding
2. **ECR Permissions**: Verified, were working correctly
3. **ECS Configuration**: Task definitions and health checks were correct

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied
1. **Updated Dockerfile**: Changed base image from:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   ```
   To:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM public.ecr.aws/docker/library/python:3.11-slim
   ```

2. **Updated Version**: Synchronized Dockerfile version with code:
   ```dockerfile
   ENV AVA_VERSION=v2.3.1-blue-debug
   ```

### Why This Works
- ECR Public Gallery doesn't have the same rate limiting as Docker Hub
- Amazon-managed, reliable for AWS services
- Same Python 3.11-slim image, different source

## Verification Results

### Build Success
- ✅ CodeBuild completed successfully
- ✅ Docker image pushed to ECR: `62d3e81` tag
- ✅ ECS service deployed new image

### Functional Verification
- ✅ Blue debug box visible at `/business-dashboard`
- ✅ Background color: `#007BFF` (blue)
- ✅ Border color: `#0056b3` (dark blue)  
- ✅ Text color: `white` for contrast
- ✅ Version: `v2.3.1-blue-debug-64752a7d`
- ✅ Mango test data intact: 16 farmers, 211.95 hectares

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Docker Hub Dependencies
**Problem**: Relying on Docker Hub for production builds
**Solution**: Use ECR public registry for AWS workloads

### 2. Build Monitoring
**Problem**: Build failures weren't immediately visible
**Solution**: Proactive monitoring of CodeBuild status

### 3. Error Analysis
**Problem**: Initial logs were misleading (DOWNLOAD_SOURCE vs BUILD failure)
**Solution**: Deep dive into CloudWatch logs for root cause

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Completed**: Switch all Dockerfiles to ECR public registry
2. ✅ **Completed**: Verify deployment pipeline works end-to-end

### Future Improvements
1. **Build Notifications**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for CodeBuild failures
2. **Alternative Base Images**: Consider AWS-specific base images
3. **Build Caching**: Implement CodeBuild caching for faster builds
4. **Automated Testing**: Add health check validation in pipeline

### Docker Hub Rate Limiting Prevention
1. **ECR Public Gallery**: Primary recommendation (implemented)
2. **Docker Hub Authentication**: Alternative if Docker Hub required
3. **Image Mirroring**: Mirror frequently used images to ECR private
