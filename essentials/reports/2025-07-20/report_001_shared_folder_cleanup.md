# Shared Folder Cleanup Report
**Date**: 2025-07-20 07:52:07 UTC | 09:52:07 CET
**Type**: Investigation
**Author**: Claude Code
**Related Services**: None - Documentation cleanup only

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive cleanup of the shared folder removed 15 obsolete subdirectories and 25+ temporary files older than 3 days (before July 17, 2025). All obsolete content was identified and removed while preserving the essentials/ folder completely untouched.

## Details

### Cleanup Scope
- **Target**: Files and folders older than 3 days from July 20, 2025 (before July 17, 2025)
- **Protected**: essentials/ folder (completely untouched)
- **Criteria**: Newer files supersede older ones; current system architecture changes make older docs obsolete

### Major Changes
1. **ECS Migration Impact**: System migrated from AWS App Runner to ECS on July 20, 2025
2. **Architecture Obsolescence**: All App Runner documentation became outdated
3. **Temporary Reports**: Investigation reports from July 18-19 completed and no longer needed

## Findings

### Removed Obsolete Subdirectories (15 total):
- `architecture/` - Contained App Runner docs, now uses ECS
- `docs/` - Superseded by essentials/ documentation  
- `implementation/` - Old implementation files pre-ECS migration
- `safety_systems/` - Old safety system implementations
- `constitutional/` - Superseded by essentials/AVA_OLO_CONSTITUTION.md
- `database/` - Old database schema files (auto-updated in essentials/)
- `examples/` - Outdated code examples
- `templates/` - Old HTML/CSS templates
- `tests/` - Old test files for deprecated systems
- `scripts/` - Old utility scripts
- `src/` - Old React components
- `web_dashboard/` - Old dashboard implementations
- `cost-monitoring/` - Old cost monitoring setup
- `shared/` - Old shared utilities
- `analysis/` - Old analysis documents
- `adf/` - Old autonomous development framework

### Removed Temporary Files (25+ files):
- **CAVA Reports**: CAVA_DEPLOYMENT_FIX_REPORT.md, CAVA_FINAL_RESOLUTION_REPORT.md, etc.
- **Constitutional Reports**: CONSTITUTIONAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md, CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE.md, etc.
- **Deployment Reports**: DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_UPDATE.md, FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_ANALYSIS.md, etc.
- **Investigation Files**: FORENSIC_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE_REPORT.md, debug_investigation.log, etc.
- **Config Files**: version_config.json, deployment_status.json, constitutional_cleanup_plan.json
- **Temporary Files**: "New Text Document.txt", monitor_deployment.py, etc.
- **Obsolete Reference**: CLAUDE_CODE_MASTER_CONSTITUTIONAL_REFERENCE.md (referenced deleted files)

### Preserved Files:
- `essentials/` folder - **Completely untouched** as requested
- `Your ECR Repository URIs.txt` - Recent (July 20) and contains current AWS ECR repositories

## Space Impact
- **Before**: 100+ files across 15+ subdirectories with extensive documentation duplication
- **After**: 2 files in root + essentials/ folder only
- **Estimated**: 90%+ reduction in file count, eliminating confusion from obsolete documentation

## Validation
### Confirmed Obsolescence:
1. **Architecture docs** referenced App Runner (now ECS)
2. **Quick start guides** outdated vs. essentials/QUICK_START.md
3. **Implementation files** pre-dated ECS migration  
4. **Temporary reports** completed their investigation purpose

### No Data Loss:
- All current/relevant information preserved in essentials/
- Current architecture documented in SYSTEM_CHANGELOG.md
- Active implementation tracked in current repositories

## Recommendations
1. **Going Forward**: Use only essentials/ for documentation
2. **Reports**: Use new reports/ system for future investigations
3. **Architecture**: Document ECS-based architecture in essentials/ if needed
4. **Validation**: Monitor next development cycle to confirm no missing references
