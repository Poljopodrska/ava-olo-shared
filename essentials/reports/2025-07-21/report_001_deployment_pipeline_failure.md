# Deployment Pipeline Failure Investigation Report
Date: 2025-01-21
Investigator: Claude Code
Severity: CRITICAL

## Executive Summary
Git pushes are succeeding but changes are not deploying to production. Root cause: GitHub Actions workflow was removed, breaking the automated deployment pipeline.

## Investigation Timeline

### 1. Initial Symptoms
- Git push: âœ… SUCCESS (credentials working)
- ALB URL: Shows old version v2.4.0 (expected v3.3.2)
- Production URL: http://ava-olo-internal-alb-426050720.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/

### 2. Investigation Steps

#### Step 1: Check AWS CodeBuild Status
```bash
aws codebuild list-builds-for-project --project-name ava-monitoring-docker-build
```
Result: Last build was at 2025-07-20 15:58:09 (yesterday)

#### Step 2: Check Recent Git Activity
```bash
git log --oneline -n 10
```
Result: Found commit `ed56dfb fix: remove workflow temporarily`

#### Step 3: Verify Workflow Status
```bash
ls .github/workflows/
```
Result: Directory does not exist - workflow was removed

#### Step 4: Check Version on ALB
```bash
curl http://ava-olo-internal-alb-426050720.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/version
```
Result: `{"version":"v2.4.0-multi-dashboard-633a1ad0","build_id":"633a1ad0"}`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy-ecs.yml) was removed in commit ed56dfb on 2025-07-20. This workflow was responsible for:
1. Triggering on pushes to main branch
2. Building Docker images
3. Pushing to ECR
4. Updating ECS services

### Impact
- All Git pushes after 2025-07-20 17:38:35 have not triggered deployments
- Production is running outdated code (v2.4.0 instead of v3.3.2)
- Manual deployment required until workflow is restored

### Workflow Content (from previous commit)
```yaml
name: Deploy Monitoring Dashboards to ECS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
    tags:
      - 'v*'

env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  ECR_REGISTRY: 127679825789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  ECR_REPOSITORY: ava-olo/monitoring-dashboards
  ECS_CLUSTER: ava-olo-production
  ECS_SERVICE: monitoring-dashboards
  CONTAINER_NAME: monitoring
```

## Immediate Fix Required

### Option 1: Restore GitHub Actions Workflow
```bash
# In monitoring-dashboards repo
mkdir -p .github/workflows
git show 6635a43:.github/workflows/deploy-ecs.yml > .github/workflows/deploy-ecs.yml
git add .github/workflows/deploy-ecs.yml
git commit -m "fix: restore GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual CodeBuild Trigger
```bash
aws codebuild start-build --project-name ava-monitoring-docker-build
aws codebuild start-build --project-name ava-agricultural-docker-build
```

### Option 3: Use AWS CodePipeline
Set up CodePipeline to watch GitHub repository directly

## Affected Services
1. **monitoring-dashboards** - No GitHub Actions workflow
2. **agricultural-core** - Needs to be checked for same issue

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Restore the GitHub Actions workflow to both repositories
2. Trigger manual builds for pending changes
3. Verify deployments complete successfully

### Long-term Prevention
1. Never remove deployment workflows without alternative in place
2. Add monitoring alerts for deployment failures
3. Document deployment pipeline dependencies
4. Consider using AWS CodePipeline as backup trigger

## Timeline of Events
- 2025-07-20 15:58:09 - Last successful automated deployment
- 2025-07-20 17:38:35 - Workflow removed (commit ed56dfb)
- 2025-01-21 ~10:00 - Git pushes made with v3.3.2 changes
- 2025-01-21 ~10:30 - Discovery that deployments not occurring
- 2025-01-21 10:45 - Root cause identified

## Conclusion
The deployment pipeline failure was caused by the removal of the GitHub Actions workflow. This is a critical configuration error that completely breaks the CI/CD pipeline. The workflow must be restored immediately to resume automated deployments.

## Update: Resolution Applied
- Manual CodeBuild triggered: Build ID be9277f5-f6e7-4b6b-aaf2-355833b5fca6
- GitHub Actions workflow already restored in commit 6635a43
- Future pushes should trigger automatically via GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Watch for successful ECS deployment completion
