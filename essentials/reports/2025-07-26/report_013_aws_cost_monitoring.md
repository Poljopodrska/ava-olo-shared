- **Savings**: ~$16-20/month
- **Impact**: Reduced from 3 ALBs to 2 ALBs
- **Status**: Completed on July 20, 2025

### 2. Budget Monitoring ✅
- **Action**: Created monthly budget with alerts
- **Limit**: $440 USD (€400 EUR)
- **Alerts**: 
  - Warning at 80% ($352)
  - Critical at 100% ($440)
- **Notifications**: knaflicpeter@gmail.com

## Additional Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)
1. **Review ECS Configuration**
   - Current: $14.44/month
   - Potential: Reduce compute allocation if over-provisioned
   - Savings: $5-7/month

2. **ElastiCache Optimization**
   - Current: $11.57/month
   - Action: Review if Redis cache is needed in development
   - Savings: $11/month if removed

3. **CloudWatch Logs Retention**
   - Current: $7.85/month
   - Action: Set log retention to 7-14 days for development
   - Savings: $3-4/month

### Medium-term Actions
1. **RDS Instance Right-sizing**
   - Current: $19.67/month
   - Review: Check actual CPU/memory usage
   - Consider: Smaller instance type or Aurora Serverless
   - Potential savings: $5-10/month

2. **ECS Task Optimization**
   - Review CPU/memory allocations
   - Current tasks may be over-provisioned
   - Potential savings: $5-8/month

3. **Elastic IP Consolidation**
   - Review need for all Elastic IPs
   - Release unused IPs
   - Savings: $3-5/month per IP

## Cost Projection Scenarios

### Current Trajectory
- Monthly: $258 USD
- Yearly: $3,096 USD
- **Status**: Well under budget ✅

### After Optimizations
- Immediate savings: $30-40/month
- Projected monthly: $220 USD
- Yearly: $2,640 USD
- **Budget utilization**: 50%

### Growth Capacity
With current budget of $440/month, the platform can support:
- 2x current traffic
- Additional services
- Production-grade redundancy
- Enhanced monitoring

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Remove old ALB
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Set up budget alerts
3. Review ElastiCache necessity in development
4. Implement CloudWatch log retention policies

### Medium Priority
1. Analyze RDS usage patterns for right-sizing
2. Review ECS auto-scaling settings
3. Audit and remove unused Elastic IPs
4. Consider Reserved Instances for stable workloads

### Low Priority
1. Enable S3 lifecycle policies for any buckets
2. Review data transfer patterns
3. Consider AWS Compute Savings Plans

## Budget Alert Configuration
- **Budget Name**: AVA-OLO-Monthly-Budget
- **Monthly Limit**: $440 USD (€400 EUR)
- **Alert Thresholds**:
  - 80% ($352): Warning notification
  - 100% ($440): Critical notification
- **Email**: knaflicpeter@gmail.com
- **Status**: Active and monitoring

## Conclusion
The AVA OLO platform is operating efficiently with only 25% of the allocated budget being utilized. The recent ALB consolidation will provide additional savings. With the implemented budget monitoring, you'll receive proactive alerts before reaching spending limits. The platform has significant room for growth within the current budget constraints.
