## 💡 Recommendations for Future

### 1. Pre-Commit Hooks (Optional)
```bash
# Validate report location
if [[ $file =~ .*REPORT.*\.md$ ]] && [[ ! $file =~ essentials/reports/[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/ ]]; then
    echo "❌ Reports must be in /essentials/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/ structure"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate git tag format
if [[ $tag != v* ]]; then
    echo "❌ Git tags must start with 'v' followed by version"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Automated Compliance Checks
- **Report Location Validation**: Weekly scan for misplaced reports
- **Changelog Completeness**: Ensure every tagged version has changelog entry
