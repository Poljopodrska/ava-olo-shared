# Docker Installation Audit Report
Date: 2025-07-20 09:37:39 CEST

## Summary
- **Docker Desktop Installed**: ✅ YES (Version 28.1.1)
- **Docker Desktop Running**: ❌ NO
- **WSL Integration Enabled**: ❌ NO (but Docker command is in PATH)
- **Docker CLI in WSL**: ✅ YES (via Windows path)
- **Can Build Images**: ❌ NO (Docker Desktop not running)

## Findings

### 1. Docker Desktop Installation
- ✅ Docker Desktop is installed at: `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker`
- ✅ Version: 28.1.1, build 4eba377
- ✅ Docker executable found: `/mnt/c/Program Files/Docker/Docker/resources/bin/docker.exe`
- ❌ Docker Desktop is NOT currently running

### 2. WSL Configuration
- ✅ WSL2 is properly configured with Ubuntu
- ✅ docker-desktop WSL distro exists but is stopped
- ❌ Docker socket not available at `/var/run/docker.sock`
- ✅ Docker command is available in WSL PATH

### 3. Docker Desktop Settings
- AutoStart: false (Docker Desktop doesn't start with Windows)
- WSL integration appears not fully enabled
- Settings file exists at: `/mnt/c/Users/HP/AppData/Roaming/Docker/settings-store.json`

### 4. Current State
- Cannot connect to Docker daemon
- Cannot build or run containers
- Docker Desktop needs to be started manually

## Recommendation
**❌ CONTINUE WITH AWS APPROACH**

### Reasoning:
1. While Docker Desktop is installed, it's not running
2. Starting Docker Desktop and enabling WSL integration would require:
   - Manual intervention outside of CLI
   - Restarting WSL/terminal session
   - Potential troubleshooting of integration issues
3. AWS approach is already 85% complete
4. Time to complete via AWS: ~5-10 minutes (just need to fix the monitoring image)
5. Time to fix via Docker: ~15-30 minutes (start Docker, enable WSL, rebuild, test)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue with AWS (Recommended)
1. The agricultural service is already running on ECS
2. Need to fix the monitoring service Docker image (missing `psutil` module)
3. Can use AWS CloudShell or EC2 instance to rebuild the image
4. Push fixed image to ECR and complete migration

### Option 2: Enable Docker Desktop (Alternative)
If you want to use local Docker for future tasks:
1. Start Docker Desktop from Windows Start Menu
2. Go to Settings → Resources → WSL Integration
3. Enable integration with Ubuntu distro
4. Restart terminal/WSL
5. Verify with `docker ps`

## Quick Fix Commands
If you decide to start Docker Desktop:
```bash
# After starting Docker Desktop in Windows:
docker --version  # Should work without full path
docker ps         # Should connect to daemon
```

## Cost Consideration
- Current: Running ECS + partial ECS (~$30-40/month)
- After completion: ECS only (~$10-20/month)
- Urgency: Medium (costing extra ~$1/day while both run)
