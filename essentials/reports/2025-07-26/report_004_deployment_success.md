## 📊 DATABASE_SCHEMA.md Status
- **Container Status**: ✅ Updating every 15 minutes
- **Last Updated**: 2.73 minutes ago (inside container)
- **Auto-Update Working**: YES ✅
- **File Path**: /app/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (inside container)

Note: The schema file updates inside the ECS container but is not synchronized to the local filesystem. This is expected behavior in a containerized deployment.

- ✅ Multi-Dashboard System - ALL DASHBOARDS ACCESSIBLE
- ✅ Business Intelligence - BUSINESS DASHBOARD LIVE

## 📈 GitHub Actions Status

- **Agricultural Build**: Triggered at 20:38 UTC
- **Deployment Method**: Automatic via GitHub Actions
- **AWS Credentials**: ✅ Configured

## 🔍 Important Notes

1. **Monitoring Service Version**: Running v3.3.24 (older version) but with schema updater features added. The latest commit deployment may still be in progress.

2. **Endpoint Variations**: Some endpoints like /cava/register returned 404 because the actual paths are:
   - /auth/register
   - /auth/register/pure
   - /auth/register/chat

3. **ALB Discovery**: Found that monitoring service uses the internal ALB, not the one initially documented.

4. **Schema Updates**: Working perfectly inside the container, updating every 15 minutes as designed.

The Bulgarian mango farmer can now:
