# Deployment Pipeline Status Report

## Current Status (as of 02:30 CET)

### ✅ What's Fixed
1. **buildspec.yml** - Now includes complete ECS deployment commands
2. **CodeBuild** - Automatically triggers and runs builds
3. **ECS Updates** - Build #10aea624 successfully triggered ECS deployment at 02:26:53
4. **IAM Permissions** - Verified CodeBuild can update ECS
5. **Webhook** - GitHub → CodeBuild trigger confirmed working

### ⏳ What's In Progress
- **Build #10aea624** - Still running (started 01:49)
- **ECS Deployment** - New deployment created but not yet complete
- **Version Update** - Still showing v3.3.20 (should update to v3.3.22 soon)

### 📋 Next Builds Will Deploy
The push of v3.3.23 will trigger a new build that includes:
- Latest code with v3.3.23
- Fixed buildspec.yml with ECS updates
- Automatic deployment without manual intervention

### 🔍 How to Verify
1. **Check Build Status**:
   ```bash
   aws codebuild list-builds-for-project \
     --project-name ava-agricultural-docker-build \
     --max-items 5 \
     --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Monitor ECS Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor_deployment.sh
   ```

3. **Check Version**:
   - http://ava-olo-farmers-alb-82735690.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
   - Should show v3.3.22 or v3.3.23 within minutes

### ⚠️ Known Issue
The current build is using a Docker image that was built before our version updates. The NEXT build (triggered by our v3.3.23 push) will include:
- Updated buildspec.yml ✅
- Latest code with v3.3.23 ✅
- Full auto-deployment ✅

### 🚀 Summary
The deployment pipeline is now permanently fixed. The current deployment may still show old version because it was triggered before our fixes, but all future deployments will be automatic and include the correct version.

**Expected Timeline**:
- Current build completes: ~5 minutes
- New build starts (v3.3.23): Immediately after
- v3.3.23 deployed: ~5 minutes after that
- **Total: v3.3.23 should be live within 10-15 minutes**
