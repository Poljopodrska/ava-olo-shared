  - `build_and_test.sh` - Build containers
  - `test_local_deployment.sh` - Comprehensive testing
- **ECS Task Definitions**: Ready for deployment

### Why This Change:
- AWS App Runner has bytecode caching issues causing partial deployments
- ECS provides better control over deployment process
- Modularization prevents large file loading issues
- Containers ensure consistent environment

### Impact:
- **User Impact**: NONE - Services remain on App Runner during prep
- **Developer Impact**: Major - new structure for all future changes
- **System Impact**: Improved reliability once migrated

### Verification:
- Local testing with Docker shows all endpoints working
- Yellow debug box visible
- Database shows 16 farmers, 211.95 hectares
- Deployment verification endpoints functional

### Next Steps:
1. Build and push containers to ECR
2. Deploy to ECS with blue/green deployment
3. Switch traffic from App Runner to ECS
4. Decommission App Runner services

## 2025-07-19 - AWS App Runner Deployment Audit [üîç INVESTIGATION]
**Deployed to Production**: NO - Investigation only
**Service Audited**: ava-olo-monitoring-dashboards-fresh
**Critical Discovery**: AWS serves different code versions for different endpoints!

### AUDIT FINDINGS:
1. **Version Mismatch** üö®:
   - /api/deployment/verify shows: v2.2.5-bulletproof-a3d8affb
   - /business-dashboard shows: v2.2.5-bulletproof-5f47f042
   - SAME deployment but DIFFERENT build IDs!

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - business_dashboard: Only 362 bytes (should be ~2KB+)
   - has_yellow_box: false (but code DOES have yellow box!)
   - AWS is loading a cached/truncated version of the function

3. **Suspicious Patterns Found**:
   - __pycache__ directory exists with 13 .pyc files
   - Multiple Python versions: cpython-38.pyc and cpython-312.pyc
   - File size: 267KB with 6454 lines (extremely large)

4. **Environment Details**:
   - Python: 3.8.20 on AWS Linux
   - No PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE set
   - AWS_APP_RUNNER_DEPLOYMENT_ID: null (not exposed)
   - Working directory: /app

5. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - AWS App Runner appears to cache function bytecode
   - Different endpoints compile at different times
   - Large file size (6454 lines) may cause partial loading
   - Python bytecode from multiple versions suggests upgrade issues

**SMOKING GUN**: The audit endpoint (added later in file) shows newer build ID than business_dashboard (defined earlier in file), proving AWS loads/caches functions at different times!

**RECOMMENDED FIXES**:
1. Split main.py into smaller modules
2. Set PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 in AWS
3. Clear __pycache__ on every deployment
4. Move business logic out of main.py
5. Add cache-busting to function definitions

**Next Steps**: Implement modular architecture to prevent partial loading

   - Dashboard ERROR display is a UI bug, not data issue

3. **Deployment Endpoints**: ‚úÖ ALL FUNCTIONAL
   - monitoring-dashboards: v2.2.5-bulletproof-8a23313d
   - agricultural-core: v3.2.5-bulletproof-2825034c
   - Both show deployment_valid: false (expected - shared folder not in AWS)

4. **Build ID Tracking**: ‚úÖ WORKING
   - Each deployment gets unique build ID
   - Old: 9786db6f ‚Üí New: 8a23313d (monitoring)
   - Old: 8e0b90a1 ‚Üí New: 2825034c (agricultural)
