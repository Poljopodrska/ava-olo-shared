# Business Dashboard "Not Found" Fix Guide

## Problem
Clicking on "Business Dashboard" returns `{"detail":"Not Found"}` because the `/business` route is not implemented in the monitoring dashboards service.

## Quick Fix

The business dashboard code needs to be added to your `ava-olo-monitoring-dashboards` repository (NOT this `ava-olo-shared` repository).

### Step 1: Locate Your Monitoring Dashboards Service

The actual service code is in: `https://github.com/Poljopodrska/ava-olo-monitoring-dashboards`

### Step 2: Add the Business Dashboard Route

In your main application file (likely `main.py` or `app.py`), add:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/business", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def business_dashboard(request: Request):
    # Copy the implementation from examples/business_dashboard_implementation.py
    html_content = """[HTML content from the example file]"""
    return HTMLResponse(content=html_content)

@app.get("/api/business/metrics")
async def business_metrics():
    return {
        "totalFarmers": "2,847",
        "messagesToday": "1,523",
        "countriesServed": "52",
        "avgResponseTime": "1.2s"
    }
```

### Step 3: Full Implementation

Copy the complete implementation from:
`/examples/business_dashboard_implementation.py`

This provides:
- A responsive business dashboard UI
- Key business metrics display
- Farmer distribution by country
- Weekly engagement trends
- Top crops analysis
- Auto-refresh functionality

### Step 4: Deploy

Once you add the route to your monitoring dashboards service and push to GitHub, it should automatically deploy to AWS App Runner.

## Alternative: Temporary Redirect

If you need an immediate fix, you could redirect `/business` to another working dashboard:

```python
@app.get("/business")
async def business_redirect():
    return RedirectResponse(url="/", status_code=302)
```

## Notes

- The `ava-olo-shared` repository only contains shared utilities and documentation
- The actual dashboard implementations must be in the `ava-olo-monitoring-dashboards` repository
- The same issue might affect `/agronomic` and `/admin` dashboards if they're not implemented
