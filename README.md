# 🌾 AVA OLO System Overview

**AVA OLO** is a constitutional agricultural CRM system serving farmers globally through WhatsApp integration. Built on AWS infrastructure with 100% LLM-first intelligence, it supports 50+ countries and languages, including minority farmers like Hungarian speakers in Croatia.

## 🏛️ Constitutional Principles

AVA OLO operates under 15 supreme constitutional principles:

### 🥭 The MANGO RULE (Most Important!)
*"Would this work for a Bulgarian mango farmer?"* - Every feature must work for any crop in any country.

### Core Principles
1. **🧠 LLM-FIRST** - AI intelligence over hardcoded logic
2. **🔒 PRIVACY-FIRST** - Farmer data never leaves our infrastructure  
3. **🌍 GLOBAL-FIRST** - Works for all farmers, all crops, all countries
4. **📱 WHATSAPP-DRIVEN** - Primary farmer interface
5. **🏗️ MODULE INDEPENDENCE** - Services work independently
6. **⚡ PRODUCTION-READY** - AWS-deployed and scalable
7. **🌐 API-FIRST** - All communication via APIs
8. **💾 POSTGRESQL-ONLY** - Single database technology
9. **🚫 NO HARDCODING** - Flexible, AI-driven decisions
10. **👨‍🌾 FARMER-CENTRIC** - Designed for farmer needs
11. **📊 TRANSPARENCY** - All actions logged and traceable
12. **🛡️ ERROR ISOLATION** - Failures don't cascade
13. **🌍 COUNTRY LOCALIZATION** - Smart detection with minority support
14. **🎨 DESIGN-FIRST** - Constitutional design system enforcement
15. **🧠 LLM-GENERATED INTELLIGENCE** - Amendment #15: "If the LLM can write it, don't code it"
